	FMMC_RC_T80 = Now that the Details are set, we should begin creating the Race. The first stage is the Trigger location, which is where players will join in GTA Online to play the Race. The Trigger is found in the "Placement" menu.
	FMMC_RC_T82 = Each Checkpoint has three respawn positions attached to it and they should be rotated to point in the direction the Race is going. If a player respawns, they will reappear at the last Checkpoint, in one of these positions.
	FMMC_RC_T83 = These positions are shown as the vehicles that follow behind the placement tool. If a position is not valid the vehicle turns red. There must be at least one respawn position per checkpoint.
